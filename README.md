# xLibrary

It's great to hear that xLibrary is utilizing Node.js to create a Telegram bot. However, I believe it's important to mention that offering and distributing copyrighted material, such as free ebooks without proper authorization, is illegal and unethical. It's essential to respect intellectual property rights and support authors by purchasing their work or accessing legal sources of content. While the idea of a bot providing diverse topics is interesting, it should be based on legally obtained materials.
